# Device enrolment: wire format (enrolment v1)

The bytes and the line protocol by which a Cairn dongle hands its server-side
identity to a server over a USB console: the sealed enrolment blob, its
fingerprint, and the console commands. Normative for the firmware
(`lib/cairn_prov`) and the server (`internal/enroll`, `cairn-provision`).
Vectors: [`vectors/vectors.json`](vectors/vectors.json), which both implementations
reproduce byte for byte.

How an operator uses this (what gets provisioned, the procedure, the residual risk,
troubleshooting) is not part of the contract: it is in the server's
`docs/device-provisioning.md`.

**Status:** implemented by the firmware and the server and exercised on real hardware.
No network credential travels over this channel: the dongle has none.

## The sealed enrolment blob

Printed by the device on request (`GET enroll_blob`). 225 bytes, little-endian,
shown as base64:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 4 | magic `CENR` |
| 4 | 1 | version = 1 |
| 5 | 16 | `device_id` |
| 21 | 32 | device Ed25519 public key |
| 53 | 4 | `storage_key_version` |
| 57 | 32 | ephemeral X25519 public key |
| 89 | 24 | XChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce |
| 113 | 32 | ciphertext of `K_root` |
| 145 | 16 | Poly1305 tag |
| 161 | 64 | Ed25519 signature by the device key over bytes `[0, 161)` |

```text
shared = X25519(eph_priv, server_enrol_pub)
key    = HKDF-SHA256(ikm = shared, salt = eph_pub ‖ server_enrol_pub,
                     info = "cairn/enroll-seal/v1", L = 32)
ct‖tag = XChaCha20-Poly1305(key, nonce, K_root, aad = bytes [0, 113))
```

- The **AAD** covers every header field, so identity, key and key version cannot
  be edited without failing the tag.
- The **signature** is proof of possession: whoever produced the blob holds the
  device's signing key, so a blob cannot enrol someone else's public key.
- The ephemeral key and nonce come from the hardware RNG. The device **refuses**
  to produce a blob while the pinned server key is the all-zero placeholder:
  sealing to a key nobody holds would "succeed" and lose the root.
- The server's enrolment private key is wrapped under the keystore master key
  (`<data>/keys/enroll.x25519`). A blob is not secret (it crosses a console, ssh
  and logs), so the key that opens it must be protected exactly like the roots it
  unlocks.
- The C implementation and the Go reference produce **byte-identical** blobs from
  the same inputs; `fixtures/enroll-v1/vectors.json` pins that and both test
  suites check it.

### The fingerprint

`FINGERPRINT` is the first 4 bytes of SHA-256(device public key), 8 hex
characters: the same value as the first half of the device key id. It is a
**mix-up check**, "the blob I am approving came from the unit on my bench", not
authentication of the channel. `cairn-admin device enroll` **requires**
`--confirm-fingerprint`; there is no approve-whatever-arrived mode. For the check
to mean anything the value should come from somewhere other than the console it
guards: a record made when the unit was first enrolled, or the label on a unit
you provisioned yourself. `cairn-provision` accepts `--expect-device-id` and
`--expect-fingerprint` for exactly that, so a non-interactive run is still a
checked one.

## The console protocol

Line-oriented ASCII at 115200 baud. Host commands, device replies prefixed
`@prov ` (the console also carries the device's log, so a bare `OK` would be
ambiguous):

| Host | Device |
|---|---|
| `CAIRN-PROV BEGIN` | `@prov PROV-READY <device_id hex> <fingerprint>` or `@prov ERR refused: …` |
| `GET enroll_blob` | `@prov ENROLL-BLOB <base64>` or `@prov ERR …` |
| `SET assignment <vehicle32hex> <assignment32hex>` | `OK` (both non-zero) |
| `SET counter_floor <n>` | `OK` (decimal u64; only raises) |
| `SET garage <slot> <vehicle32hex> <assignment32hex> <engine>` | `OK` (slot 0-3; ids non-zero; engine an `engines/` profile id, `[a-z0-9-]`, at most 23 characters; one vehicle and one assignment per slot) |
| `COMMIT` | `OK`, or `ERR <reason>` (staged values kept; re-send) |
| `CAIRN-PROV END` | `OK` |

`SET wifi_ssid`, `SET wifi_pass`, `SET client_cert` and `SET client_key` no longer
exist and are answered `ERR unknown field`. A host script written for the old
firmware therefore **cannot** put a private key on a current dongle, which is the
point; a host test asserts it.

A successful `COMMIT` closes the session; the device stays silent about lines
sent outside one.

**Garage.** A dongle that moves between cars is given one `SET garage` line per car
(each car's assignment is open on the server at the same time: `cairn-admin assign
--keep`). Any `SET garage` in a session makes the garage exactly the slots set in that
session; a slot provisioned again with the same vehicle and assignment keeps the VIN it
had learned. `SET assignment` in the same session names the car the dongle is in now;
without one, the installed assignment is kept if it is one of the garage's cars, else the
first slot's is installed. The device stores a truncated SHA-256 of each car's VIN once
seen, never the VIN. At runtime it switches to the car its VIN identifies (a learned VIN,
else the one unbound slot whose engine the VIN names; never a guess between two) and
seals the open bundle with bundle-region transition `reason_code` 4 (vehicle
identified). A server files a boot whose bundles name two cars under the car named last
in it, since unplugging powers the dongle off and a boot is therefore one car.

**Rules.**

- **Never during a trip**: whenever the controller is past Idle.
- An **unassigned** device accepts a session at any time (nothing to protect).
- An **assigned** device accepts one only in the first **60 s after boot**, so
  an unattended unit cannot be re-provisioned by someone who plugs in later.
  `cairn-provision --reset` pulses the board's reset line and then begins.
- A session idles out after **30 s** and its staged values are scrubbed.
- The assignment and the counter floor are idempotent and the floor only rises, so
  a `COMMIT` that reports failure is safe to simply send again.
- **No secret is ever echoed or logged.** The log records events and field
  *names* only. A host test sends a canary through every path and asserts it
  appears in no reply and no log line, raw or base64.
