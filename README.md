This repository is the **front door** of Cairn: the system documentation, the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md),
the shared [contracts](contracts/) every other repository builds against, and the small Go tools and CI
that keep those honest. The code for each part lives in its own repository (see [the map](#the-repositories)).

## What it is, in plain words

You plug a small device into your car's diagnostic port (the one under the dashboard that a
mechanic uses). It quietly records every drive: where you went, how fast, and how the engine
was behaving. When you get home, your iPhone carries those recordings to a small server that
**you** run (a spare mini PC or a Raspberry Pi is enough). You then open a web page and see
your drives: a map of everywhere you have been, your trips by day, and detailed engine
information if you care about it.

Nothing is sent to a company. There is no account to create and no subscription. If you stop
using it, your data is in files you already own.

Cairn is built first for car enthusiasts who like to look at their own data, and it is meant
to be approachable enough for anyone who simply wants a private record of their driving.

### Why it is built this way

A car's location history is among the most revealing data a person generates: it names your home,
your work, and your routine. Commercial trackers keep it on their servers. Cairn is shaped by the
opposite constraint, and most design decisions follow from it:

- **The recorder must work with no network at all.** Every trip is a valid, sealed, recoverable
  file on the dongle's SD card before any server is involved.
- **Encrypt before anything leaves.** The card, the phone and the wire only ever carry ciphertext.
- **Nothing is deleted on faith.** The dongle deletes a recording only after your server hands back
  a *signed receipt* for exactly that recording.
- **Every part can be replaced.** Formats and protocols are written down, versioned and tested
  ([contracts](contracts/)), so the seven repositories agree by specification, not by sharing code.

## Why use it

1. **Useful automatic capture.** Plug it in and drive. Trips are recorded without opening
   any app, and they appear on their own.
2. **Detailed vehicle information.** The engine data behind every trip is there to browse,
   per trip and per vehicle: boost, fuel trims, temperatures, how the car responds when you
   push it.
3. **Control of your data.** It lives on your hardware. Nothing needs an account or a cloud
   service. (Export, import and backup exist today for saved places and for the whole
   store; extending that to every kind of data is a roadmap theme.)
4. **Adaptability.** More than one car, more than one phone. The file and wire formats are
   public and tested ([contracts](contracts/)), so you can read your own data with your own
   tools or extend the system without reverse-engineering it.
5. **Private by design.** Data is encrypted on the device before it leaves, and only your server
   can read it. Whichever way a trip travels — the phone, Wi-Fi or the dongle's own cellular link —
   the carrier moves ciphertext it cannot read, alter or delete.

## How the pieces fit

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    car["Car OBD-II port<br/>(power and engine data)"] --> dongle["Dongle<br/>ESP32 firmware<br/>GNSS, IMU, OBD, microSD"]
    phone["iPhone app<br/>(GPS assist and relay)"] -- "BLE: phone GPS in" --> dongle
    dongle -- "BLE: sealed bundles out<br/>(ciphertext only)" --> phone
    phone -- "HTTPS, signed requests<br/>LAN or Tailnet" --> server["Vehicle server<br/>(your computer)"]
    server --> cas[("Ciphertext store<br/>and keystore")]
    cas --> tsdb[("Analytical store<br/>in-memory DuckDB")]
    tsdb --> web["Web dashboard<br/>passkey or Tailnet identity"]
    server -- "signed receipt" --> phone
    phone -- "receipt over BLE" --> dongle
```

The dongle deletes a recording only after the server has returned a signed receipt for exactly
that recording, checked against a key built into the dongle. The phone only carries bytes: it
cannot read, alter or forge them.

**Shipped since 2026-10-07:** the dongle also uploads by itself over **LTE**, in addition to BLE.
The car's dongle has a SIMCOM SIM7600A-H modem (LTE Cat-4, B2/B4/B12 only), and the firmware
attaches, opens a TLS session to the server through a Tailscale Funnel ingress, uploads sealed
bundles and prunes each one on a receipt it verifies against a key pinned in firmware.

It carries **whole sealed bundles, not digests** — the owner's decision on 2026-10-07, reversing
the earlier plan. A digest earns no receipt, so it can never authorise a prune, which means a
digest-only transport never frees the card. The volume turns out not to need compressing: a trip
is about 230 KB, so a 2 GB plan carries some nine thousand of them, and sealed segments are AEAD
ciphertext that `gzip -9` only reduces to 90% of raw anyway.

Wi-Fi is implemented and proven, and has been switched on in the production build since
2026-10-14, when stopping the BLE controller for the slot got around the coexistence failure
([firmware #31](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/issues/31)).
**Since 2026-10-23, though, neither radio uploads:** Wi-Fi association fails at the home router
(`AUTH_FAIL`) and LTE registration is denied by the network
([firmware #55](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/issues/55)). Until that
is fixed, bundles leave the car on the SD card. See
[Roadmap](#roadmap-in-brief), the [uplink contract](contracts/uplink/v1/README.md), the
[cellular design](docs/lte-cellular-design.md), and the firmware's
[uplink status](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/blob/main/docs/network-uplink-status.md)
for exactly what has run on hardware.

### One drive, from the road to the dashboard

    S-->>W: Trips, maps, engine detail
```

The relay and the dongle's side of the offload are specified in
[`sync/v1` section 13](contracts/sync/v1/spec.md) and [`ble/v1/offload.md`](contracts/ble/v1/offload.md).
If any step fails, nothing is lost: the bundle stays on the card until a receipt arrives. The
status of each step on real hardware is under [Where things stand](#where-things-stand).

## The trust model in one page

The organising rule: **the SD card is never the security boundary.** It is a removable cache of
ciphertext. Trust lives in keys the device holds, in the server's keystore, and in identities that
can be revoked. Everything uploaded is untrusted until its signature, vehicle assignment, counter
and integrity chain verify. The full argument is in [docs/trust-model-v3.md](docs/trust-model-v3.md),
and every threat with its mitigation and residual risk is in [docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md).

```mermaid

        kroot["Storage root key<br/>(random, generated on the device)"]
        kseg["Per-segment key<br/>(HKDF, salted with vehicle id)"]
        sign["Ed25519 device signing key"]
        pin["Pinned receipt public key"]
        kroot --> kseg
    end
    subgraph carrier["Anything in between: untrusted"]
        card["SD card:<br/>ciphertext frames"]
        ble["BLE link and phone:<br/>ciphertext only"]
        net["LAN or Tailnet:<br/>TLS plus signed requests"]

    subgraph server["Your server: trusted"]
        enrol["Enrolment:<br/>root sealed to server key,<br/>human approves"]
        ks["Keystore:<br/>escrowed roots, wrapped"]

    end

    ble --> net
    net --> ks
    kroot -. "sealed blob, once" .-> enrol
    enrol --> ks
    rcpt -- "signed receipt" --> pin
```

**Rule zero: encrypt first.** Data is encrypted on the device before it is stored on the card or
offered to any carrier, and that part holds unconditionally
([threat model](docs/threat-model.md#rule-zero-encrypt-first)).

The second half of rule zero — *no network credential on a unit until flash and NVS encryption are
enabled on it* — **was traded away on 2026-10-07, knowingly.** It could not be met: the car's chip
is ESP32 revision v1.0, flash and NVS encryption are eFuse burns, burns are ruled out on the only
unit, and gating the network behind them blocked the network permanently rather than ordering it.
So the Wi-Fi passphrase, the APN, the pinned CA and this device's client key are compiled into the
gitignored `include/secrets.h` and are therefore in plaintext flash. **What that costs, exactly:** a
flash dump permits uploading *as* this device and reading what it uploads — it does **not** permit
deleting anything, because a prune requires a server-signed receipt verified on-device. The narrower
replacement, a credential key the chip cannot reconstruct alone, is
[Phase 28](ROADMAP.md#phase-28--the-networked-dongle-finished--in-progress).

| Mechanism | What it does | Where specified |
|---|---|---|
| **Encrypted storage** | Every frame is AEAD-encrypted with a random 24-byte nonce (never derived from the sequence number, because a torn-tail rewrite legitimately reuses a sequence number). Keys are per segment, derived from the device root and salted with the vehicle id, so two cars sharing a dongle are cryptographically separated. Integrity (CRC chain, Merkle root) can be checked without any key | [`format/v3`](contracts/format/v3/spec.md), [trust model section 3](docs/trust-model-v3.md) |
| **Device enrolment** | The dongle emits a blob: its public key plus its storage root *sealed to the server's enrolment key*, signed as proof of possession. A human approves it on a trusted workstation after comparing the fingerprint the dongle shows. No unauthenticated endpoint creates trust | [`enrolment/v1`](contracts/enrolment/v1/spec.md), [trust model section 4](docs/trust-model-v3.md) |
| **App enrolment** | A one-time invitation (10 minute lifetime, single use, stored only as a hash) lets the phone register a P-256 key held in the Secure Enclave. Every request after that is signed, with a timestamp window and a nonce against replay | [`sync/v1`](contracts/sync/v1/spec.md) |
| **Signed receipts** | The server signs a receipt that names a bundle's content root. The dongle prunes only after verifying a receipt against a key pinned in firmware, so a hostile phone cannot forge one, replay one for another bundle, or make the dongle delete anything | [`format/v3`](contracts/format/v3/spec.md), [`ble/v1/offload.md`](contracts/ble/v1/offload.md) |
| **Per-vehicle keys and scope** | A vehicle is explicit in every segment header and manifest. A monotonic device counter is bound to content: the same counter with different content is a forgery or a rolled-back device and is quarantined | [trust model section 2](docs/trust-model-v3.md) |
| **Revocation** | Revoking a device or an app client takes effect on the next request, without a restart. Destroying a stored root crypto-shreds every copy of that device's history, including backups | [trust model section 3.1](docs/trust-model-v3.md) |
| **Tailscale is reachability, not authorisation** | A device on your Tailnet is not thereby a Cairn client. The **app** listener rejects Funnel-marked requests outright. Funnel *is* used, for one narrow purpose: a raw TCP ingress for the dongle's cellular uplink, where TLS is not terminated at the edge, so the mutual authentication survives end to end and the Funnel edge carries ciphertext it cannot read | [trust model section 1](docs/trust-model-v3.md), [cellular design](docs/lte-cellular-design.md) |

What is **not** claimed: protection from a compromised server (it holds the roots), from an attacker
holding the live, unlocked dongle (revoke it), or from someone who dumps an ESP32 on which flash
encryption is not yet enabled. Honest limits are part of the design; see
[Security and privacy posture](#security-and-privacy-posture).

## The repositories

Seven repositories, each of which can be built, tested and released alone, and one shared
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md) that sequences the work across all of them.

| Repository | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **this one**, [cairn-driving-log-selfhosted](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-driving-log-selfhosted) | The front door: system documentation, the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), the shared [contracts](contracts/) and their checker, the link checker, the pin dashboard, the CI runner installer |
| [cairn-esp32-device-firmware](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware) | The in-car dongle. Captures GNSS, IMU and OBD into encrypted append-only segments, seals bundles, serves BLE (phone GPS in, offload out), verifies receipts and prunes. Has a host test suite and a Rust emulator (C, Rust) |
| [cairn-trail-device-firmware](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-trail-device-firmware) | The trail device: a handheld LILYGO T-Beam Supreme (ESP32-S3, u-blox M10 GNSS, barometer; its LoRa radio held off) that records hikes, walks and dongle-less drives into the same `format/v3` bundles, in Rust on `esp-hal` + Embassy. **Designed, nothing built** — a README, hardware notes and a contract pin ([plan](docs/trail-device-plan.md)) |
| [cairn-ios-companion-app](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-ios-companion-app) | The iPhone app. Feeds the dongle phone GPS over BLE; is becoming an enrolled, signing client of the server; will relay bundles (Swift) |
| [cairn-vehicle-server](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-vehicle-server) | Your server. Enrols devices and apps, verifies, stores and decodes bundles, issues signed receipts, serves the phone API and the analytical store (Go) |
| [cairn-vehicle-web-dashboard](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-vehicle-web-dashboard) | The browser dashboard. Reads the analytical store through server-side routes; signs in with a passkey or a Tailnet identity (Nuxt) |
| [cairn-modules](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-modules) | The modules. Boost, fuel economy, trims, driving style, the speedometer check and place kinds, each one package carrying its dongle, server, web and app parts. `modgen` validates a module set against the pinned contracts and emits what each surface needs (YAML, Rust). **Nothing is wired in yet** |
| [cairn-original-monorepo-archive](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-original-monorepo-archive) | The original single repository, preserved read-only. Every component repository keeps its history |

The split happened on 2026-10-05; the plan and what was executed are in
[docs/repo-split-plan.md](docs/repo-split-plan.md).

## The contracts

[`contracts/`](contracts/) holds the specifications and test vectors that the repositories share.
A repository does not copy them; it pins a release by tag **and** commit (`contracts.lock`) and
fetches that, so a change to a contract cannot reach an implementation unnoticed. The collection is
tagged `contracts-vX.Y.Z` only when contract content changes; the latest is
**`contracts-v0.8.0`** (2026-10-15), and every consumer is pinned to it
([changelog](contracts/CHANGELOG.md)). Each protocol directory is versioned independently, and a
breaking change adds a new directory (`format/v4`) rather than editing an old one.

| Protocol | What it is | Producers / consumers | Version | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`format`](contracts/format/v3/README.md) | Sealed trip bundles: encrypted segments, manifest, receipt, update descriptor | firmware writes; server and emulator read | v3 | **stable**; 59 byte-exact vectors including negatives, reproduced by three implementations (Go, Rust, C) |
| [`enrolment`](contracts/enrolment/v1/README.md) | The sealed enrolment blob and the USB console protocol | firmware produces; server verifies | v1 | **stable**; vectors (including 32 negative blobs and 5 stateful sequences) reproduced by two implementations; exercised on real hardware |
| [`sync`](contracts/sync/v1/README.md) | The phone's API to the server: signing, enrolment, push/pull, snapshot, bundle relay | server implements; app consumes | v1 | **draft**: the server implements it, the iOS app does not yet; 83 generated exchanges, no independent consumer has validated them |
| [`ble`](contracts/ble/v1/README.md) | The dongle's BLE service: phone GPS, status, bundle offload, device info, check-in | firmware serves; app consumes | v1 | companion **stable**; `device-info` **stable** since 0.4.0 (four implementations agree); offload implemented on the firmware and a Go reference client but not on the phone; `checkin` and the uplink/instruction characteristics **draft** |
| [`store`](contracts/store/v1/README.md) | The analytical store the web dashboard queries (`schema.json`, machine-checked) | server produces; web consumes | v1 | **draft** |
| [`engine`](contracts/engine/v1/README.md) | Engine profiles in two halves: how to read an ECU (PIDs, the formula language, cadence, sleep) and what the readings mean (labels, axes, warning limits) | firmware compiles the acquisition half; server reads the analysis half | v1 | **draft**: 105 formula vectors reproduced by three implementations (Rust, C, Go), 20 invalid profiles, 19 analysis profiles; the in-document identifiers keep their `-draft`/`v0` suffixes |
| [`module`](contracts/module/v1/README.md) | Modules: interpretation separated from the logging core, one package carrying its dongle, server, web and app parts. Manifest, derived columns, metrics, named queries | server, web, app and the firmware's generator consume | v1 | **draft**: schemas, spec and 39 vectors; **two** implementations (`modgen` in cairn-modules, and the server's `internal/modules`), and the server runs module-owned derivations. Views, metrics and named queries are not implemented yet |
| [`uplink`](contracts/uplink/v1/README.md) | How a dongle with Wi-Fi or LTE uploads bundles itself: device-signed requests, a pinned server key, offer/chunk/commit/receipt | reserved for the firmware; server | v1 | **draft**: spec and 15 vectors only, nothing implements it |
| [`share`](contracts/share/v1/README.md) | A portable trip export with redaction | reserved | v1 | **reserved, draft**: no design until the threat model's sharing section is satisfied |
| [`beacon`](contracts/beacon/v1/README.md) | A sealed LoRa position beacon from the trail device: *last seen*, provisional, never a record | reserved for the trail device; a home gateway | v1 | **reserved, deferred**: the owner chose on 2026-10-25 to keep the trail device's LoRa radio off |

Version and status are read from [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md); what changed in each
release, including unreleased documentation edits, is in [contracts/CHANGELOG.md](contracts/CHANGELOG.md).
Vector keys are public test keys committed to a public repository: they protect nothing and must never
be used for anything real.

### The contract-first loop and pinning

A contract change starts here, is proven by an implementation, and only then is adopted by the
others, one pin bump at a time.

Everything that needs the specs reads the directory named by `CAIRN_CONTRACTS` (always the
`contracts/` directory itself). Setting it to a local checkout lets you change a contract and its
implementation together on one machine; release builds refuse the override. No CI job holds
permission to tag or publish: a maintainer does. The rules for what counts as breaking are in
[contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md#versioning-and-releases).

The current pins, generated from each repository's lock files by
[`tools/cmd/pin-dashboard`](tools/README.md) (a weekly workflow opens a pull request when they drift):

<sub><b>Behind</b> counts the releases cut after each pin, from this repository's own tags, so a stale pin is a decision
somebody took rather than something nobody looked at. A pin that is behind is not automatically wrong — a repository
bumps when it needs the change — but it should be visible either way. Every consumer is on the current release as of
2026-10-15; what each one actually consumes is in <a href="ROADMAP.md#contract-pins-and-what-a-bump-unblocks">the roadmap</a>.</sub>

## Where things stand

Honest status, as of **2026-10-24**, separating what has run on real hardware from what has only
run on a host. The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md#where-cairn-is-today) carries the detail, the evidence for
each claim, and what closes each open item.

| State | What |
|---|---|
| **Proven on hardware or in the live deployment** | Capture, sealing and encrypted storage on the car's dongle. Device enrolment and key escrow, verified against the real device's sealed blob. **All three transports:** the BLE offload chain (2026-10-06 — nine bundles in 62 s, nine receipts verified on the device, nine bundles pruned), Wi-Fi mTLS (2026-10-07 — four bundles delivered and pruned) and **LTE** (2026-10-07 — T-Mobile US through the public Funnel ingress, 158,906 bytes, verified receipt, pruned; then a whole trip unattended at 1.29 MB in 386 s). TLS verification proven from the failing side: a deliberately wrong pinned CA is rejected. The server deployed with intake, receipts, escrow, vehicle and counter binding, and since 2026-10-15 refusing GNSS fixes the car contradicts (`v_position_trusted`) and dating bundles the dongle sealed without a clock (27 repaired). The dashboard deployed with every route authenticated, period statistics, search, the Phones page and GPS-source comparison, and since 2026-10-15 every page per trip, across boots, on one clock. The iPhone app on TestFlight, with CarPlay signed and running |
| **Built, not yet proven** | Firmware `6e62b44`, flashed 2026-10-23 and not yet driven: drive capture rebuilt after the dongle lost almost every drive between 2026-10-15 and 2026-10-23, a GNSS plausibility gate, and every bundle in a boot dated. Secure OTA (host-verified; the install has never run on the dongle, so every firmware change needs USB). The OBD-sampling fix — landed, and **one drive away** from confirmation. `sync/v1` on the phone (the client is built and vector-checked; no screen drives enrolment). Module derivations in the server, with no module view, metric or query yet. The phone's own GPS in a real trip: the live store holds **zero** phone positions |
| **In progress** | [Phase 27](ROADMAP.md#phase-27--a-trip-you-can-trust--in-progress), a trip you can trust: correct dates, OBD coverage proportional to duration, a distance that matches the route. Then [Phase 28](ROADMAP.md#phase-28--the-networked-dongle-finished--in-progress) (an upload path that works again, OTA, the credential key, data caps the user sets) and [Phase 29](ROADMAP.md#phase-29--the-phone-becomes-the-app--in-progress) (the app replaces the Go reference phone). Tailnet reach: installed, the login approval pending |
| **Open defects** | Eighteen rows, [all listed](ROADMAP.md#open-defects), one of them fixed. The newest is the worst: **since 2026-10-23 no path uploads a bundle from the car** (Wi-Fi refused at the router, LTE registration denied, [firmware #55](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/issues/55)) and there is no OTA, so bundles leave on the SD card and firmware goes on over USB. Four are fixed or worked around in code and waiting on a drive, and seven legacy v2 bundles are stranded on the card because both ends are now v3 |
| **Planned** | Insight (a tune record, baselines, a plain health summary), sharing with redaction, the module system reaching the web and the phone, browser-based flashing, a v2 → v3 data migration, and chip hardening on whatever hardware replaces this dongle |

**Hardware constraint.** There is exactly one real dongle, a Freematics ONE+ whose chip is an
ESP32-D0WDQ6 **revision v1.0**. ESP32 Secure Boot V2 needs revision v3.0 or later, so it is not
available on that unit, and the weaker V1 scheme is irreversible and not planned. What applies
instead: application-layer encryption of every frame (shipped), signed OTA images (written), a
credential key the chip cannot reconstruct on its own ([Phase
28](ROADMAP.md#phase-28--the-networked-dongle-finished--in-progress)), and revocation of a stolen
dongle. Flash and NVS encryption are reassigned to replacement hardware
([Phase 34](ROADMAP.md#phase-34--chip-hardening-on-replacement-hardware--planned-gated)).
Details: [trust model section 7](docs/trust-model-v3.md) and the firmware's
[esp32-hardening](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/blob/main/docs/esp32-hardening.md).

## Roadmap in brief

The full document is **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** — the only roadmap in the project, covering all
seven repositories. This is the short version.

**The next three phases, in order:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    p27["<b>Phase 27</b><br/>A trip you can trust<br/><i>dates · OBD density · engine stamp</i>"]
    p28["<b>Phase 28</b><br/>The networked dongle, finished<br/><i>coexistence · credential key · limits</i>"]
    p29["<b>Phase 29</b><br/>The phone becomes the app<br/><i>BLE offload + enrolment on iOS</i>"]
    m3["<b>M3–M4</b><br/>Modules reach the store and the web"]
    p27 --> p28 --> p29
    p27 --> m3
```

Phase 27 is **one drive away**: firmware `6e62b44`, flashed 2026-10-23, carries every fix for the
1970 dates, the phantom GNSS fixes, the starved OBD sampling and the drives lost between
2026-10-15 and 2026-10-23, and none of it is verified on the road. What that drive must show is
[listed in the roadmap](ROADMAP.md#what-the-next-drive-must-show). Nothing is scheduled ahead of it.

**Product themes**, in the order the owner chose (it is theirs to change), each additive to the
contracts and following the contract-first loop:

1. **History** — statistics for any period; bookmark, tag and search a route. *Shipped.*
2. **Vehicle insight** — a tune record so "since the tune" has a meaning, baselines, and a plain
   "is my car healthy?" view. *In progress.*
3. **Sharing** — pick trips, preview and export a redacted file. A file the owner sends, never a
   hosted service. The threat model's sharing section comes first.
4. **Approachability** — plain language everywhere, simple views by default. *Continuous.*
5. **Data control** — export, import and backup for every store that holds user data. *Partly
   shipped.*

**The sixth repository.** Interpretation is leaving the logging core: boost, fuel economy, trims,
driving style, the speedometer check and place kinds each become a module carrying its dongle,
server, web and app parts in one package
([cairn-modules](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-modules),
[plan](docs/module-system-plan.md)). Two stages are done and the server already runs a
module-owned derivation; this is how "a new metric can be added by configuration, not by editing
core code" finally becomes true.

**The seventh repository.** A second device for when there is no car, or no dongle in it: a
handheld recorder for hiking and walking, on a LILYGO T-Beam Supreme
([cairn-trail-device-firmware](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-trail-device-firmware),
[plan](docs/trail-device-plan.md)). It writes the same sealed bundles and reaches the same server;
what it adds is elevation, steps and a display; its LoRa radio is held off to save battery. Scheduled as
[T1–T8](ROADMAP.md#t1t8--the-trail-device--designed), beside the dongle's phases and never ahead
of them. Nothing is built.

**Where things stand by phase:** the v2 data path (1–12) is complete; the analytical store and the
dashboard (13–18) are in progress; v3 trust, vehicles, the encrypted format and the sync API
(19–22) are done; Tailscale deployment (23) is in progress; chip hardening (24) is reassigned to
replacement hardware as 34; iOS adoption (25) continues as 29; "No Wi-Fi" (26) is superseded, and
its BLE offload shipped as one of three transports.

## Build and run

Cairn is built from source; there are no prebuilt release artifacts. Each repository states its
own toolchain, build and test commands in its README; start there.

| Part | Repository | Toolchain |
|---|---|---|
| Server and admin tools | [cairn-vehicle-server](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-vehicle-server) | Go; PostgreSQL with PostGIS for the decode tests; a C toolchain for the DuckDB store |
| Dashboard | [cairn-vehicle-web-dashboard](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-vehicle-web-dashboard) | Node.js, Nuxt |
| Dongle firmware and emulator | [cairn-esp32-device-firmware](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware) | PlatformIO (Arduino on ESP-IDF); Rust for the emulator |
| Trail device firmware | [cairn-trail-device-firmware](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-trail-device-firmware) | Rust: `esp-hal` + Embassy on the `espup` Xtensa toolchain, `espflash`; nothing to build until T1 |
| iPhone app | [cairn-ios-companion-app](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-ios-companion-app) | Xcode, Swift |
| Modules and their generator | [cairn-modules](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-modules) | Rust for `modgen`; nothing else yet |
| This repository's tools | here, [`tools/`](tools/README.md) | Go |

A typical order for a fresh install: stand up the server with its deploy guide, enrol the dongle
(the server's device-provisioning guide), flash the firmware, install the app, then point the dashboard
at the server. Remote access is through Tailscale on the host only (never Funnel, never port
forwarding).

> [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) is the order to install the parts in and the few things that are only
> true across repositories. Each repository's own README is the authority on building it.

To work on this repository:

```bash
cd tools
go vet ./... && go test ./...
go run ./cmd/contract-check ../contracts           # every protocol version complete and valid
go run ./cmd/link-check -check -root ..            # every relative link in every .md resolves
go run ./cmd/pin-dashboard --readme ../README.md   # regenerate the pins block (add --check to only test)
```

## CI and the self-hosted runner

Three workflows run on every push and pull request to `main`; a fourth runs weekly and on demand:

| Workflow | Checks |
|---|---|
| [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | The runner policy (`tests/check-runners.sh`, plus a self-test that it can actually fail); `go vet` and `go test` for the tools, including the generators whose tests fail if checked-in vectors drift |
| [`contracts.yml`](.github/workflows/contracts.yml) | Every protocol version under `contracts/` is complete and valid. Whether a vector is *correct* is decided by independent implementations in their own repositories |
| [`docs.yml`](.github/workflows/docs.yml) | Every relative link in every markdown file resolves; links across repositories must be absolute URLs |
| [`pins.yml`](.github/workflows/pins.yml) | Weekly and on demand: regenerates the pins table from the component lock files and opens a pull request on drift. Nothing here tags or publishes a contract |

Every job runs on a **self-hosted runner**, never a GitHub-hosted one. A runner belongs to one
repository (this is a personal account), so each repository has its own, and they all share one
memory cap on a single host that also serves the running system.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    gh["GitHub: push or same-repo pull request"] --> job["Job: runs-on self-hosted, cairn"]
    fork["Pull request from a fork"] -. "guard: job skipped" .-> none["Never reaches the runner"]
    job --> pod["Rootless Podman container<br/>one per repository<br/>started by a user systemd unit"]
    subgraph slice["cairn-ci.slice: MemoryHigh 3G, MemoryMax 4G, shared by every runner"]
        pod
    end
    policy["tests/check-runners.sh fails the build if:<br/>a job is not on the runner,<br/>a job lacks the same-repo guard,<br/>a workflow uses pull_request_target or workflow_run"] --> job
```

- [`tools/runner/install-runner.sh`](tools/runner/install-runner.sh) installs one runner for one repository as a rootless Podman container under a user systemd unit. The registration token is read from the first line of stdin, never an argument, and written only to a `0600` file; the registration is persisted so a restart needs no new token.
- [`tools/runner/cairn-ci.slice`](tools/runner/cairn-ci.slice) is the shared cap. The host also runs production services with limited RAM, and an uncapped parallel build once wedged it; one slice makes the cap hold for the sum of all runners.
- The trusted-code policy exists because the runner executes code on a machine that also serves production: fork pull requests are never run on it, and the two workflow triggers that run with the base repository's privileges on code a stranger influences are banned.

## Security and privacy posture

- **No cloud, no account, no telemetry.** Nothing in the system contacts a third party. The only things that leave the owner's hands are deliberate exports.
- **Encrypted at every hop that is not your server.** The SD card, the BLE link and the phone carry ciphertext only; the server's raw store is the same ciphertext, and keys live in a wrapped keystore apart from the data directory.
- **Authentication supports both passkey and Tailnet identity.** The web dashboard accepts a **passkey** (a WebAuthn session; the only identity that may add or remove credentials, and only when recently used) or a **Tailnet identity** (a device owned by an allowlisted Tailscale login; it can read and change saved places but cannot manage credentials), plus a read-only service token for deploy checks. The phone authenticates to the server with per-request signatures from a Secure Enclave key, revocable on the next request, and Tailnet reachability alone is never a credential.
- **Revocation over cleverness.** A stolen running dongle or a lost phone is handled by one admin action, not by hoping hardware helps.
- **Known weak points, stated:** a static BLE passkey is the weakest part of the dongle bond, and the shipped build currently uses Just Works pairing with bonds cleared each boot (a challenge-response with the enrolled app is [Phase 29](ROADMAP.md#phase-29--the-phone-becomes-the-app--in-progress)); the server can read everything because it must decode; flash and NVS encryption are **not** on and cannot be, so a chip dump of the current dongle reveals its storage root, its signing seed and its network credentials; there is no secure boot on the car's unit.
- **The networked dongle shipped before its review.** Its threats (N1 to N14) were written down and gated before the firmware existed, and then the gate was traded away on 2026-10-07 to get the transports working. That model's **independent review has not happened**. The cost is bounded and stated above: a flash dump permits impersonation and reading, not deletion. Closing it is [Phase 28](ROADMAP.md#phase-28--the-networked-dongle-finished--in-progress), including the threat-model update.
- **A public repository holds no real values.** Host names, addresses, keys and identifiers in the documents are placeholders (`user@host`, `<tailnet-name>`); real values live in ignored local files. The vector keys are public test keys.

## FAQ

**Do I need a cloud account or an internet connection?** No. The system works on your LAN, with
optional private remote access over your own Tailnet.

**Does it work without the iPhone?** Yes, on both halves. Recording never needed a phone: trips are
sealed on the dongle's card with no phone and no network. And since 2026-10-07 the dongle uploads by
itself over its own cellular link, so a trip reaches the server with no phone involved at all. The
phone remains the preferred path when it is there, because BLE is free and already in range.
Whichever path is used, nothing is lost if it fails — nothing is deleted without a receipt.

**What happens if my phone is lost or stolen?** Revoke that app client on the server and its requests
stop working on the next call. The phone never held the keys to read trips, and cannot forge a
receipt.

**How do I sign in to the dashboard?** With a passkey, or from a device on your Tailnet whose
Tailscale login you have allowlisted. A first passkey is created from an allowlisted Tailnet device or
with a one-time code on the server. Both are supported on purpose, and neither needs a cloud account.

**Does the dongle upload over Wi-Fi?** It can, and it has — four bundles over mutual TLS on
2026-10-07 — but Wi-Fi is switched **off** in the production build, because it cannot associate while
the BLE controller is initialised ([firmware
#31](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/issues/31)). LTE carries the data in
the meantime. The direct-upload contract ([`uplink/v1`](contracts/uplink/v1/README.md)) is specified
and the firmware still uses the older device listener; swapping it is
[Phase 28](ROADMAP.md#phase-28--the-networked-dongle-finished--in-progress).

**Why not Secure Boot?** The one real dongle is ESP32 silicon revision v1.0, which cannot do Secure
Boot V2; the V1 alternative is weaker and permanent. See [Where things stand](#where-things-stand).

**Can I run Tailscale on the dongle?** No, not realistically on this chip. Tailscale runs on the
server host and the iPhone.

**Does it work with my car?** It reads standard OBD-II data and is developed on BMW N20 and B58
engines, where fuel trims and mixture say more about health than boost. Per-engine profiles are real:
`engine/v1` specifies both halves of a profile — how to read an ECU, and what the readings mean —
with 105 formula vectors reproduced by three independent implementations, and the firmware compiles
in the profiles you choose. Adding a car means writing a profile, not editing the firmware. There is
no Android app in this project.

**Can I share a trip?** Not as a redacted export yet — that is
[Phase 31](ROADMAP.md#phase-31--sharing-and-data-control--planned), and its constraints are written
first ([threat model](docs/threat-model.md#sharing-design-constraints-before-any-design)); it will be
a file you send, never a hosted service. You can already save a trip as a high-resolution picture
from the dashboard.

**Can I read my data without Cairn's software?** That is what the contracts are for: the bundle
format and the analytical store are specified and versioned, and the store can be exported as Parquet.

**Is the old single repository gone?** It is preserved read-only as
[cairn-original-monorepo-archive](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-original-monorepo-archive).

## Contributing

- **Issues and ideas** go on the repository that owns the work — [who owns
  what](ROADMAP.md#who-owns-what) says which. The roadmap links every open one, grouped by the phase
  it belongs to, so an issue should not need its own plan.
- **There is one roadmap.** Do not start a `ROADMAP.md` in a component repository: a README says what
  that part *is* and what it has running, and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) says what happens next
  everywhere.
- **Changing a protocol** starts here, following [the contract-first loop](#the-contract-first-loop-and-pinning)
  and the rules in [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md): draft the change with an implementation
  branch, generate vectors (including negative cases), have the spec and expected outputs reviewed, and
  for any byte-level change have at least one independent consumer validate them. Changes are additive
  unless a new version directory is added. A maintainer tags; consumers then bump their pins.
- **Documentation:** keep relative links inside a repository and use absolute URLs across repositories
  (`docs.yml` enforces it). Use placeholders, never real hosts or keys.
- **Before you open a pull request** run the tool checks listed under [Build and run](#build-and-run).
  Pull requests from forks do not run on the self-hosted runner by design, so a maintainer runs the checks.
