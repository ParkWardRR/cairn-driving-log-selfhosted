# Cairn Vehicle Data Protocols

The wire formats and vectors that the parts of Cairn agree on: the dongle's firmware, the
server, the web dashboard and the phone app — and, planned, the trail device's firmware. Each
can be built, tested and released alone; what they share is here, versioned, and checked by
machine.

| Protocol | What it is | Producers / consumers | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`format/v3`](format/v3/) | Sealed trip bundles: encrypted segments, manifest, receipt, update descriptor | firmware writes; server and emulator read | **stable**, 33 vectors reproduced by three implementations |
| [`enrolment/v1`](enrolment/v1/) | The sealed enrolment blob and the USB console protocol | firmware produces; server verifies | **stable**, vectors reproduced by two implementations |
| [`sync/v1`](sync/v1/) | The phone's API to the server: signing, enrolment, push/pull, snapshot, bundle relay | server implements; app consumes | **draft**: the server implements it, the iOS app does not yet |
| [`ble/v1`](ble/v1/) | The dongle's BLE service: phone GPS, status, and bundle offload | firmware serves; app consumes | **stable** for the companion; **offload** is implemented on the firmware and a Go reference client, not yet on the phone |
| [`store/v1`](store/v1/) | The analytical store the web dashboard queries | server produces; web consumes | **draft**: surface described, schema machine-checked (`schema.json`) |
| [`engine/v1`](engine/v1/) | Engine profiles, in two halves: how to read an ECU (PIDs, the formula language, cadence, sleep) and what the readings mean (labels, axes, warning limits) | firmware compiles the acquisition half; server reads the analysis half | **draft**: schemas and normative text here, 105 formula vectors reproduced by three implementations; the identifiers keep their `-draft`/`v0` suffixes until the gate in its README is met |
| [`module/v1`](module/v1/) | Modules: interpretation separated from the logging core, one package carrying its dongle, server, web and app parts. Manifest, derived columns, metrics, named queries | server, web, app and the firmware's generator consume; a module set produces | **draft**: schemas, spec and 39 vectors, one checker; nothing implements it yet |
| [`uplink/v1`](uplink/v1/) | How a dongle with Wi-Fi or LTE uploads bundles itself: device-signed requests, a pinned server key, the relay's offer/chunk/commit/receipt | reserved for the firmware; server | **draft**: spec and vectors only, nothing implements it yet |
| [`share/v1`](share/v1/) | A portable trip export with redaction | reserved | **reserved, draft**: no design until the threat model has a sharing section |
| [`beacon/v1`](beacon/v1/) | A sealed LoRa position beacon: *last seen*, provisional, never a record | reserved for the trail device; a home gateway | **reserved, draft**: no design until the threat model has a section for it |

### A second device: the trail device (planned)

A handheld recorder for hiking, walking and occasional driving without the OBD-II dongle — a
LILYGO T-Beam Supreme (ESP32-S3, u-blox MAX-M10S, SX1262 LoRa, BME280, SH1106 OLED). It is
**Designed, nothing built**; the plan is [docs/trail-device-plan.md](../docs/trail-device-plan.md)
and its firmware is
[cairn-trail-device-firmware](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-trail-device-firmware).

It writes **`format/v3` unchanged in layout**, enrols through **`enrolment/v1` unchanged**, offloads
through **`ble/v1`** and is meant to be the first implementer of **`uplink/v1`**. What it needs from
these contracts is additive and **not yet in any spec**: three record types (`BARO_SAMPLE`,
`POWER_STATUS`, `ACTIVITY_SUMMARY`), four `TRIP_EVENT` types, the `RTC` time source defined, an
optional manifest `device_class`, a device-class record in `ble/v1` device info, a `kind` on the
vehicle (*carrier*) in `store/v1` and `sync/v1`, and activity views in `store/v1`. The proposed
layouts are in [§11 of the plan](../docs/trail-device-plan.md#11-contract-changes); each lands
through the process below, with all three `format/v3` implementations moving together.

## Versioning and releases

- The collection is versioned with semver and tagged `contracts-vX.Y.Z`, **only when
  contract content changes**. Documentation edits elsewhere do not release anything.
- Each protocol directory is versioned **independently** of the collection tag
  (`format/v3`, `enrolment/v1`, ...). A breaking change to a protocol adds a new directory
  (`format/v4`); it never edits an old one in place.
- **Breaking, for the collection:** removing or renumbering a field, record type or
  endpoint; changing a byte layout, a canonical form or a signing string; tightening what a
  consumer must accept. **Not breaking:** adding an optional field, a record type old
  readers skip, an endpoint, a vector, or clarifying prose.
- **Retention:** an old protocol directory stays for as long as any supported consumer
  still uses it. Firmware is the long pole (devices in cars update slowly), so a
  firmware-facing format stays at least until no supported firmware produces it. Each
  protocol's README states its support window.
- **Tags are protected and publishing is manual.** No CI job holds permission to tag or
  publish a contract; a maintainer does.

## Using them from another repository

A repository records exactly which contracts it was built against in `contracts.lock`
(the tag **and** the resolved commit), and fetches them into `.contracts/`. Everything that
needs the specs or vectors reads the directory named by **`CAIRN_CONTRACTS`**, which is
always *this* `contracts/` directory (the one that contains `format/`, `sync/`, `store/`),
never a checkout root. Unset, the tools look for `./contracts` (this repository) and then
`./.contracts/contracts` (a fetched copy). To change a contract and its implementation
together on one machine, point `CAIRN_CONTRACTS` at a local checkout; release builds
refuse an override.

## How a contract changes

```text
draft the contract change + the implementation branch
-> generate candidate vectors
-> review the spec and the expected outputs
-> candidate conformance checks pass
-> merge, then a maintainer tags contracts-vX.Y.Z
-> consumers bump their pin and release
```

For a byte-level change, **at least one independent consumer** must validate the candidate
vectors before tagging. A generator reproducing its own output proves determinism, not
correctness.

## Vectors

Deterministic and offline. They include negative cases (malformed input, authentication
failures, unsupported versions) because a consumer that only passes valid input has not
been tested. **Every key in them is a public test key committed to a public repository.
They protect nothing, and must never be used for anything real.**
