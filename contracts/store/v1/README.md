# Analytical store v1 (draft)

What the web dashboard relies on from the server's analytical store, `cairn-tsdb`. Its
objects and columns are pinned in [`schema.json`](schema.json); this file carries the rest.

**Tables:** `bundles`, `position`, `imu`, `obd`, `boost`, `status`, `transition`, `gap`, from **`store/v1.1`** `tune`, from **`store/v1.3`** `time_obs`, and from **`store/v1.7`** `wifi_scan` and `wifi_ap_obs`.
**Views:** `v_telemetry`, `v_reproducibility`, `v_vehicles`, `v_drive_summary`,
`v_trip_summary`, `v_trim_map`, `v_boost_curve`, `v_pulls`, `v_speed_agreement`,
`v_gnss_sources`, from **`store/v1.1`** `v_boot_start`, `v_metric_samples`, `v_tune_effect` and
`v_health_stats`, from **`store/v1.2`** `v_trip_period`, from **`store/v1.6`** `v_position_trusted`, and from
**`store/v1.7`** `v_wifi_ap_learned` and `v_wifi_scan_unfixed`. **Table macros** (`store/v1.2`):
`period_summary(from_day, to_day)`. Every table, view and macro result carries `vehicle_id`
except `time_obs`, which is keyed on the frame that carried the observation.

**`schema.json`** lists every table and view (and, from `store/v1.2`, every macro) with its columns and DuckDB types, and the
`store/v1.N` it was generated from. It is generated, not written: the server's
`go run ./cmd/dump-schema` starts the real store and dumps the schema it built for itself.
It is read as a **compatible range**: a server release satisfies it when it has every listed
table and view, each listed column under a compatible type, and at least that minor. A pinned
macro must also exist with the same parameter names in the same order. Extra
tables, views, macros and columns are allowed (that is what a minor adds), and column order does not
matter. A **compatible type** is the same type, or a wider integer of the same signedness
(`UINTEGER` to `UBIGINT`); anything else (`VARCHAR` to `INTEGER`, `FLOAT` to `DOUBLE`,
signed to unsigned, narrowing) is a retype and breaks the contract. The server's CI compares
its native schema with the pinned file; this repository's CI checks only the file's own
shape (valid, known fields, every object has `vehicle_id`).

### Time observations (`store/v1.3`)

**`time_obs`**: one row per source per wall-clock reading, carrying `utc_ms`, the accuracy
that source claimed, which source it was, and whether the device adopted it as the bundle's
basis. The frame's own `mono_ms` is the other half: `utc_ms - mono_ms` is the UTC of
monotonic zero that source implies, which is the figure that makes sources comparable and
drift visible within one trip.

It has **no `observed_at`**, deliberately, because a row whose job is to establish the time
cannot be stamped with the time it is establishing. For the same reason it does not carry
`vehicle_id` as the other objects do — it is keyed on the bundle and frame that carried it.

**`boost.pedal_pct`** arrives in the same minor: accelerator pedal position from PID 0x49.
It is a distinct signal from `obd.throttle_pct`, which is the throttle *plate* angle and
does not reach 100% at wide-open throttle on a drive-by-wire engine. `NULL` means not
measured, which every row written before the column existed necessarily is.

### Wi-Fi scans (`store/v1.7`)

**`wifi_scan`** is one row per scan (format v3 §4.13), **`wifi_ap_obs`** one per access point it
saw, joined on `(vehicle_id, boot_id, seq)`. There is no SSID anywhere. `flags` bit 0 marks a
learning scan, taken beside an accepted GNSS fix.

**`v_wifi_ap_learned`** places each access point at the signal-weighted centre of the trusted
fixes beside the learning scans that heard it (within 2 s, under 20 m/s), with `spread_m` the RMS
distance of those sightings; it needs two sightings and drops one that spread over 300 m (a bus, a
train). **`v_wifi_scan_unfixed`** lists scans with no trusted fix within 5 s either side, with
`est_lat`, `est_lon`, `est_accuracy_m` and `est_aps` from the learned access points, `NULL` when
none is known. A consumer may refine an estimate (the owner's places, an external service) but
must not treat it as a fix, take a speed from it, or add it to a distance.

### Periods (`store/v1.2`)

A view cannot take a parameter, so a summary for any date range is a **table macro**, and the
per-trip rows it is built from are a view a caller can group by calendar period itself. Both
are reached through `POST /query` like any other object.

**`v_trip_period`**: one row per trip (`vehicle_id`, `boot_id`), listing `started_at`,
`ended_at`, `started_on`, and the first day of the trip's ISO week (`week_start`, a Monday),
`month_start`, `quarter_start` and `year_start` (all `DATE`), then `duration_ms`, `distance_m`,
`max_obd_speed_kph` and `max_gnss_speed_kph`. The measures are `v_trip_summary`'s own:
`duration_ms` is the span of everything observed (not only the OBD), `distance_m` sums
great-circle steps between device fixes at most 5 s apart, `max_obd_speed_kph` is
`v_drive_summary.max_speed_kph`, and `max_gnss_speed_kph` is `max_gnss_speed_mps * 3.6`.
`distance_m` and the maxima are `NULL` where the trip has no such samples.

**`period_summary(from_day, to_day)`**: one row per vehicle with a trip in the range
(`vehicle_id`, `trips`, `duration_ms`, `distance_m`, `max_obd_speed_kph`, `max_gnss_speed_kph`).
Arguments are dates or `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.

```sql
SELECT * FROM period_summary('2026-03-01', '2026-04-01') WHERE vehicle_id = '<hex>';  -- March
SELECT year_start, count(*) AS trips, sum(distance_m) AS distance_m
FROM v_trip_period WHERE vehicle_id = '<hex>' GROUP BY year_start ORDER BY year_start;  -- per year
```

**The rules**

- **The range is half-open: `[from_day, to_day)`.** `from_day` is included and `to_day`, the
  first day after, is not, so a month and the next month neither overlap nor leave a gap, and
  "1 to 10 March" is `('2026-03-01', '2026-03-11')`. An inverted or empty range is zero rows.
- **A trip belongs to the period it started in.** Its period is that of `started_at`, the first
  observation on any source, and the whole trip counts there: a drive from 23:59 on 31 March
  to 00:01 on 1 April is a March trip with all its distance and time, and none of it is April's.
  A trip is never split across periods.
- **Days are UTC.** `observed_at` is a timezone-less UTC estimate, so `started_on` and the
  period starts are UTC calendar days and no session `TimeZone` setting changes them. A
  consumer that wants local days passes UTC range edges for its zone's midnight or accepts that
  a late-evening trip in the Americas is the next UTC day.
- **A trip with no wall-clock time** (`started_at` is `NULL`) belongs to no period and is not in
  `v_trip_period`; it is still in `v_trip_summary`.
- **No row means zero.** A vehicle with no trip in the range has no row; a consumer treats
  absence as zero trips, 0 m and 0 s.
- **Types.** `trips` and `duration_ms` are `BIGINT`, `max_obd_speed_kph` is `SMALLINT`.
  DuckDB widens `sum(BIGINT)` to `HUGEINT`, which `POST /query` returns as a string; cast
  (`sum(trips)::BIGINT`) when summing the macro's columns.
- **Isolation.** Every join carries `vehicle_id` equality, so one car's trips can never be
  counted in another's period even where boot ids and start times coincide.

**Endpoints** (loopback, no authentication of their own): `POST /query`, `GET /healthz`,
`GET /capabilities`, `GET /status`, `POST /reload`, `GET /metrics`, `GET /snapshot`
(Parquet, optionally `?vehicle=` and `?format=`), plus the server's local vehicles API for
display names.

## `GET /healthz`

Answers "are you serving, which build are you, and which store contract do you implement?".
The last two are what a deploy check compares: a version number alone would not notice a
release that removed a view the dashboard queries. The response is `200` with a JSON body:

```json
{"status":"ok","build":{"version":"<version>","commit":"<40 hex>"},"store_contract":"store/v1.0"}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `"ok"` while the server is serving |
| `build.version` | string | The build's version label, for example the output of `git describe`; `"dev"` when none was stamped in |
| `build.commit` | string | The commit the binary was built from; `"unknown"` when the toolchain recorded none |
| `build.modified` | boolean | Present, and `true`, only when the tree the binary was built from had uncommitted changes (so the commit alone cannot reproduce it). **Omitted when false** |
| `store_contract` | string | `store/v<major>.<minor>`: the store contract this server implements (see the rule below) |

When the store did not reproduce from the bundles (and the server was not started to serve
unreproduced data anyway), or no store is loaded, `/healthz` is `503` with a plain-text body
(`not reproducible`), not JSON. A consumer reads the status code first and parses the body
only on `200`.

Before this field set existed the body was the bare text `ok`. A consumer that compared the
whole body to `ok` must instead parse the JSON and read `status`. Consumers must ignore
fields they do not know.

## `GET /capabilities`

What the store that is serving actually offers, read from its live catalogue rather than from
a list that was true when someone last edited the code. The response is `200` with a JSON
body (`503` with a plain-text body if no store is loaded yet):

```json
{
  "build": {"version": "<version>", "commit": "<40 hex>"},
  "store": {
    "store_contract": "store/v1.0",
    "schema_fingerprint": "<64 hex>",
    "tables": ["boost", "bundles", "..."],
    "views": ["v_boost_curve", "v_drive_summary", "..."],
    "columns": {"<table or view>": ["vehicle_id", "..."]},
    "column_types": {"<table or view>": ["VARCHAR", "..."]},
    "macros": {"period_summary": {"parameters": ["from_day", "to_day"], "columns": ["vehicle_id", "..."], "column_types": ["VARCHAR", "..."]}}
  },
  "endpoints": ["POST /query", "GET /healthz", "GET /capabilities", "..."]
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | object | The same object as in `/healthz` |
| `store.store_contract` | string | The same value as in `/healthz` |
| `store.schema_fingerprint` | string | Lowercase hex SHA-256 of the sorted lines `<name>.<column> <TYPE>`, one per column of every table and view (from `store/v1.2` also `macro <name>.<column> <TYPE>` per macro result column and `macro <name>(<parameters>)` per macro), joined by `\n`. It changes when any column or macro is added, removed or retyped, so two servers with the same fingerprint have the same schema |
| `store.tables` | array of string | Every base table in the store, sorted by name |
| `store.views` | array of string | Every view in the store, sorted by name |
| `store.columns` | object | For every table and view, its column names in declared order |
| `store.column_types` | object | Parallel to `columns`: the DuckDB type of each column, as the catalogue spells it. Added after `/capabilities` first shipped (with the `schema.json` check), so a consumer should treat it as optional |
| `store.macros` | object | From `store/v1.2`: every table macro by name, with its `parameters` in order and the `columns` and `column_types` it returns. Macros are not in `information_schema`, so they are listed separately; a consumer should treat the field as optional |
| `endpoints` | array of string | The endpoints the server serves, each as `<METHOD> <path>` |

`tables`, `views` and the keys of `columns` are what [`schema.json`](schema.json) pins, so a
consumer can compare the two: every table, view and column in `schema.json` must be present
here (under a compatible type), and extras are allowed. As with `/healthz`, ignore fields you
do not know.

## The rule

This contract is **additive**. The `store_contract` string is `store/v<major>.<minor>`:

- The **minor increments on any additive change**: a new table, a new view, a new macro, or a new column on
  an existing one. An additive change never changes what an existing object or column means.
- **Removing, renaming or repurposing a table, view or column is `store/v2`**, a new major.
  So is retyping a column incompatibly (see the compatible-type rule above).
- A server satisfies a consumer that needs `store/vN.M` when its major is `N` and its minor is
  at least `M`. A different major is a different contract.

The server enforces this with a test that fails when the schema it builds changes without the
minor and the fingerprint being updated together. The web layer's queries are the real
consumer, which is why the route inventory runs against a store started from the server
release the web repository pins, and why a deploy check reads `store_contract` from
`/healthz`.

- **Status:** draft (the schema is machine-checked; `/healthz` and `/capabilities` are documented here from the implementation, not yet machine-checked).
