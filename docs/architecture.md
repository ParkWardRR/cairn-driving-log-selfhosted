# Architecture

Cairn is an offline-first car journal: an **in-vehicle recorder** that works with
no network, a **homelab server** that receives, verifies and stores what it
records, and an **iOS companion** that is both the dongle's GPS assist and a
first-class client of the server. No cloud account is involved at any point.

The trust model that ties these together is in
[trust-model-v3.md](trust-model-v3.md); this page is the component map.

### Transport paths

The dongle has three transport paths, tried in order of preference:

1. **BLE → iPhone → Tailscale/LAN → server** (shipped). The phone pulls
   sealed bundles over BLE and uploads them. The preferred everyday path.
2. **LTE, when the drive ends away from the phone** (working since 2026-10-07).
   ~~Wi-Fi at home~~ was the second path and is **dropped (2026-11-05)**: the
   ESP32 has one radio, a Wi-Fi slot takes the whole BLE stack down with it, and
   the workaround for that cost more than Wi-Fi ever earned. Two transports now.
3. **The phone audits LTE** (planned). On a ready BLE link it reconciles the
   server's view of this device against the dongle's delivery ledger, re-offers
   what never arrived and prunes what did. The unattended path is checked by the
   attended one rather than trusted.

   Detail on the LTE path, which is otherwise as it was: Carries **whole sealed bundles**,
   not digests — the owner reversed the digest plan, because a digest earns no
   receipt and so can never authorise a prune, which means a digest-only path
   never frees the card. Compression was measured and dropped: sealed segments
   are AEAD ciphertext that `gzip -9` reduces only to 90% of raw, and a trip is
   about 230 KB anyway. User-set monthly caps are still to be enforced on the
   dongle ([firmware #21](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-esp32-device-firmware/issues/21)).
   The SIM7600A-H on the car's dongle is LTE-FDD B2/B4/B12 only, so no B71 and
   no B13 — Verizon is out. TLS runs on the ESP32 rather than in the modem,
   because the Tailscale Funnel ingress requires SNI; measured throughput is
   ~3 KB/s, bounded by the 115200 UART and an `AT+CIPSEND` round trip per
   1024 bytes.

The full cellular design, including connectivity paths to the homelab, radio
scheduling, data budgets, and privacy constraints, is in
[lte-cellular-design.md](lte-cellular-design.md).

## Core rules

1. **The device never needs the server to complete a drive.** Every trip is a
   valid, sealed, recoverable bundle on the card before any network exists.
2. **The card is never the security boundary.** It holds ciphertext only; trust
   roots live in device-held keys, the server's keystore and revocable
   identities.
3. **Everything uploaded is untrusted until it verifies**: signature, vehicle
   assignment, counter and integrity chain.
4. Raw, sealed bundles are authoritative; everything derived is disposable and
   must prove it reproduces (ROADMAP invariants 1–5).

Cairn's core is GPS logging management — capture, custody, receipt-gated prune,
decode, trips. Everything that *interprets* the readings (boost, fuel economy,
fuel trims, driving style, speedometer error, place kinds) is still inside that
core today; [module-system-plan.md](module-system-plan.md) is the plan to move it
out into modules that carry their dongle, server, web and iOS parts in one
package. None of it is implemented.

## Components

### Device — Freematics ONE+ Model B (`firmware/cairn-v2`)

Classic ESP32 WROVER. Captures GNSS, IMU and OBD into append-only,
CRC-chained, **AEAD-encrypted** segments; seals them into Ed25519-signed
bundles; **has no Wi-Fi** (dropped 2026-11-05) and no network credentials beyond the LTE APN: the enrolled phone pulls
sealed bundles over BLE and uploads them for it ([ble-offload.md](../contracts/ble/v1/offload.md)).
It prunes a bundle only after verifying a signed server receipt (handed back by the
phone) against a key pinned in firmware. The BLE service also accepts phone GNSS
fixes. No LTE. Tailscale does not run here.

### Server (`server/`, Go)

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `format` | Bundle format (frames, segments, manifest, Merkle, receipts, update descriptors) — the reference implementation; C firmware and Rust emulator must agree byte-for-byte |
| `internal/devices` | Enrolment, signing key, revocation (effective immediately) |
| `internal/vehicles` | Vehicles and device→vehicle assignments |
| `internal/counters` | Per-device monotonic counter bound to content; replay/rollback detection |
| `internal/keystore` | Escrowed per-device storage roots, wrapped; crypto-shredding |
| `internal/intake` | Manifest-first, hash-addressed, resumable upload; issues signed receipts |
| `internal/cas`, `outbox`, `ledger`, `receipts` | Raw store, decode queue, lifecycle audit, receipt signing |
| `internal/clients`, `syncapi`, `audit` | Enrolled app identities, sync protocol, audit trail |
| `internal/decode`, `store`, `worker` | Idempotent, reproducible decode into PostgreSQL/PostGIS |
| `internal/tsdb`, `cmd/cairn-tsdb` | In-memory DuckDB analytical view, rebuilt from the CAS and card on every start |
| `cmd/cairn-admin` | Vehicles, assignments, invitations, client revocation |
| `cmd/cairn-verify`, `cairn-ledger`, `cairn-push`, `cairn-signfw` | Verifier, ledger reader, SD-to-server pusher, offline firmware signing |

### UI (`ui/`, Nuxt 3)

Reads the analytical store through server-side routes proxying to `cairn-tsdb`;
never SQL from the browser.

### iOS companion (separate repository)

BLE GPS assist plus, in v3, an enrolled server client with an encrypted local
store, a durable outbox and local-first/Tailnet-fallback sync. See ROADMAP
Phase 25.

### Side tooling (optional, must not affect a drive)

The Rust emulator (`emulator/`): a byte-level conformance check of bundle
format v3 against the committed vectors, and a fault-injection matrix. The
former Gleam, MoonBit, Odin and Zig tooling was retired on 2026-10-05; see
ROADMAP.md "Decisions".

## Data flow

```text
capture → AEAD frames on SD → seal (manifest: vehicle, assignment, counter, key version)
   → BLE offload to the phone → relay offer → chunks by hash → commit → signed receipt
   → receipt handed back over BLE → verified prune
        ↓
   CAS (ciphertext) → decode with escrowed key → PostgreSQL / DuckDB → UI, app sync

   LTE when the phone is away → same offer/chunk/commit/receipt protocol
   (planned) phone reconciles the server's ledger against the dongle's → re-offer or prune
```

## Listeners

| Listener | Auth | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| `:8443` device ingest | mTLS required at handshake | **legacy**: no dongle uses it now; retired once the relay is proven (Cairn #7) |
| `:8444` app API | server TLS; signed requests | iOS app on LAN |
| `127.0.0.1:8445` app API | loopback HTTP; signed requests; Tailscale Serve headers trusted only from loopback | iOS app over the Tailnet |
| `127.0.0.1:8480` cairn-tsdb | loopback | UI server |
| *(planned)* device uplink | TLS 1.3; pinned SPKI; device-signed requests | Dongle over LTE ([uplink/v1](../contracts/uplink/v1/spec.md)). Wi-Fi dropped 2026-11-05; `path=wifi` stays valid in the contract for historical rows |

Remote access is **Tailscale only**, on the host, never Funnel, never port
forwarding. See [tailscale-deployment.md](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-vehicle-server/blob/main/docs/tailscale-deployment.md).
The planned device uplink is a narrow, authenticated surface for the dongle
only; see [lte-cellular-design.md](lte-cellular-design.md) §3 for the
connectivity path options and [uplink/v1 §8](../contracts/uplink/v1/spec.md)
for reachability.

## Deployment

systemd units on the VM (`deploy/systemd`: `cairn-server`, `cairn-tsdb`, `cairn-ui`),
installed by `deploy/deploy-v3.sh` and `deploy/deploy-ui.sh`; Caddy fronts the UI
only. PostgreSQL and any MQTT broker are installed on the host separately and are
not shipped in this repository (schema: `deploy/migrations/`). See
[deploying.md](https://github.com/ParkWardRR/cairn-vehicle-server/blob/main/docs/deploying.md).
